# Dart on the Map

# Welcome!
Welcome to Dart on the Map! 

This application is inspired by the idea of throwing a dart on a map and traveling to the place it strikes. We support spontaneity and hope to bring this idea to fruition through our site. Plan your upcoming travel whether destination known or unknown. With Dart on the Map, let your spontaneous side shine and let the dart decide. 

Where will you go next?

Give a new place a try.

Discover a new culture.

Try a new food. 

Enjoy a different view.  

Andâ€¦

Let chance decide.

It may seem scary, but we are firm believers that, 'taking the road less traveled can make all the difference.' At Dart on the Map, take the scary out of spontaneous travel and recieve help planning your trip.
